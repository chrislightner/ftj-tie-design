                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>On a field trip, a student disobeyed instructions, left the group, fell and was injured. His
                        parents sued
                        the
                        teachers who led the trip, alleging improper supervision.</li>
                      <li>A member of a religious club was injured on school property and sued. The school board refused
                        to defend
                        the
                        principal named in the suit, alleging the principal acted recklessly in allowing the school to
                        be used by
                        the
                        religious club.</li>
                      <li>A teacher was sued for failure to supervise after a student was injured using a table saw in
                        shop class.
                      </li>
                      <li>A university administrator was sued for challenging a professor tenure recommendation.</li>
                      <li>A school refused to defend its principal who was accused of failing to take action to stop
                        harassment of a
                        student. The school claimed its liability policy excluded emotional distress and harassment of a
                        student by
                        other students.</li>
                      <li>A teacher who accused an aide of insubordination was sued by the aide for false accusations
                        that led to
                        termination.</li>
                      <li>A university professor was sued for putting a student on academic probation that resulted in
                        the student's
                        dismissal.</li>
                      <li>A superintendent authorized repairs to a school. Years later, when the repairs were alleged to
                        have been
                        faulty,
                        resulting in a lawsuit, a new school board refused to defend the superintendent on grounds that
                        he did not
                        have
                        authority to authorize the repairs.</li>
