          <li>A member of a religious club was injured on school property and sued. The school board refused to defend

            principal named in the suit, alleging the principal acted recklessly in allowing the school to be used by
            the

          <li>A teacher was sued for failure to supervise after a student was injured using a table saw in shop class.

          <li>A university administrator was sued for challenging a professor tenure recommendation.</li>
          <li>A school refused to defend its principal who was accused of failing to take action to stop harassment of a
            student. The school claimed its liability policy excluded emotional distress and harassment of a student by
            other students.</li>
          <li>A teacher who accused an aide of insubordination was sued by the aide for false accusations that led to
            termination.</li>
          <li>A university professor was sued for putting a student on academic probation that resulted in the student's
            dismissal.</li>
          <li>A superintendent authorized repairs to a school. Years later, when the repairs were alleged to have been
